v1.5.1
v1.5.0
Error correction and optimization resulted in a 80% reduction in the time to export PDF and IMG files. The ability to export only to PDF without having to generate images was added.
Fixed create dirs if exportImg and exportPDF are false.

v1.4.14
Remove pdfkit dependency, using canvas instead. Now this package has only one dependency, canvas.
